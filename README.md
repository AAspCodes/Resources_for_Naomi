# Internships:
## Technical Interviews:
### Behavioral Questions:
  - [STAR Method of answering questions](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique)
  - Practice Practice Practice.
### Code puzzles:
  - Try and do one coding puzzle a day.
  - Work on it for max 30 minutes
  - Take a quick 5-10 minute break, and then comeback and just look at the solution.
  -  We don't need to reinvent the wheel, we just need to get good at recognizing when a wheel is a solution.
  -  As you work through the puzzles, speak outloud everything you are thinking. It feels unatural but it is great practice for interviews.
  - [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/): most popular.
  - [hackerank](https://www.hackerrank.com/): similar to leetcode but has better solution explanations imo.
  - [Coding Interview Tips](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/coding-interviews-for-dummies-5e048933b82b/)
