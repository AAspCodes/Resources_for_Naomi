# Media:
## Films:
- "Hidden Figures" available on DisneyPlus, the story of how a couple black women mathmaticians/computer scientists were critical in making the Apollo missions possible.

## Youtube:
### Videos:
  - [Ada Lovelace: first programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QQ3gWmd20s&ab_channel=TEDxTalks)
  - [I suck at coding](https://youtu.be/GvBgPBVcjEM)
  - [hidden history of women in tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YPlrs9-IVM&ab_channel=TEDArchive)
### Channels:
  - [fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship): great for quick intros to a topic/language/tool
  - [crash course: computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo&ab_channel=CrashCourse): very approachable quick overview of the full range of computer science areas of focus.
  - [crash course: Artifical Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvYYFloV0aA&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtO65LeD2p4_Sb5XQ51par_b&ab_channel=CrashCourse): same idea as the above, but focused on AI/Machine Learning
  - [missing semester](https://www.youtube.com/c/MissingSemester): college lectures about topics that don't get covered in most CSE programs.
  - [tech with tim](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWithTim): good for learning python
  - [free code camp](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp): great for LONG(very long) form in-depth tutorials


# Internships:
## Technical Interviews:
### Behavioral Questions:
  - [STAR Method of answering questions](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-to-use-the-star-interview-response-technique)
  - Practice Practice Practice.
### Code puzzles:
  - Try and do one coding puzzle a day.
  - Work on it for max 30 minutes
  - Take a quick 5-10 minute break, and then comeback and just look at the solution.
  -  We don't need to reinvent the wheel, we just need to get good at recognizing when a wheel is a solution.
  -  As you work through the puzzles, speak outloud everything you are thinking. It feels unatural but it is great practice for interviews.
  - [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/): most popular.
  - [coding puzzle short list](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions)
  - [hackerank](https://www.hackerrank.com/): similar to leetcode but has better solution explanations imo.
  - [Coding Interview Tips](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/coding-interviews-for-dummies-5e048933b82b/)
### Some Resource from my Internship Readiness course:
  - see CSE 492 folder
  - contains lecuture slide deck (sadly the lecture recordings are no longer available)
  - resume and career guide made by the instructor whom is also the recruiter who recruited me for my internship.



# Tools/Technologies consider learning:
- git
- bash/command line interface/terminal
- i'll add more later


# Sites I love:
- [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/): my first stop (after [fireship](https://www.youtube.com/c/Fireship)) when i decide to learn a new language. This site has great gamified tutorials for learning the basics of a language.
